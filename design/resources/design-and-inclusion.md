December 12, 2016 — Products and services can be designed to be exclusive or inclusive — it’s a conscious choice, and it’s often about the traditional tradeoffs of quality, price, and deadlines to achieve greater margins and profitability. However, computational products and services have ushered in a new world where we can now ship products instantaneously at marginal costs close to zero — which brings unprecedented and immediate accessibility to the largest total addressable market imaginable via the Internet. It means that the nature of design needs to change, and also the way we think of *who* we are designing for needs to change. I’ve just begun this journey within the WordPress universe, and I’ll be sharing what I’ve gathered thus far on how more inclusive approaches to design are the key to better designed products and service in tech.

Even so, it’s easy to forget that the people we interact with and those who access and interact with our creations are just that: People. Learn how to make empathy and acceptance driving forces for your interactions and designs to build great informational experiences for everyone.
