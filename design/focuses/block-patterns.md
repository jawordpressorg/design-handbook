Feedback is still incoming and we expect to continue to make improvements during the beta period.

## Block patterns?

With work well underway for [Full Site Editing](https://make.wordpress.org/design/handbook/focuses/full-site-editing/), we must start looking at the different ways users will create pages and layouts on their websites.

The Block Patterns feature will give users access to a catalog of various pre-made patterns (made of blocks) that will allow users to easily create and modify engaging layouts for their content.

Initially, we envision the Block Patterns library to be made up of patterns provided by themes, plugins, core defaults, and even generated by users.
