# Full site editing

The goal of the full site editing project is to utilize the power of Gutenberg’s block model in an editing experience beyond post or page content. In other words, the idea is to make the entire site customizable. This editing mode will understand the structure of the site and provide ways to modify global elements like headers and footers.

## Overview

There are three major areas being worked on in relation to a full site editing experience: Full site editing, Block patterns, and Global styles.

### Full site editing (template manipulation)

This is the primary project for most things related to full site editing. Most issues and PRs will fall under this project and largely involve template manipulation and navigating the full site editor.

### Block patterns

The Block Patterns feature will give users access to a catalog of various pre-made patterns (made of blocks) that will allow users to easily create and modify engaging layouts for their content.

### Global styles

Global styles extends the efforts of [Full Site Editing](https://make.wordpress.org/design/handbook/focuses/full-site-editing/) in bringing a higher level of customization to Gutenberg and WordPress. Together, these features enable users to have improved control over aesthetics and layouts beyond the context of single Pages and Posts.
