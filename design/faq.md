## What does WordPress design encompass?

WordPress design encompasses a couple different territories:

*   The interface and experience design of the WordPress software itself
*   The interface and experience design of [official WordPress.org plugins](https://profiles.wordpress.org/wordpressdotorg#content-plugins)
*   The WordPress.org website, and its various subsections like Make, the Devhub, the Support forums, etc.
*   Promotional and marketing materials for WordPress, in collaboration with the Marketing and Community teams

## What should I do if I have a design suggestion?

If you have a design suggestion for any part of the WordPress project, you can do one of the following:

*   Jump into the [#design](https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/design) channel on [Making WordPress Slack](https://make.wordpress.org/chat) and suggest it; one of the design team reps will chat with you about your suggestion and steer you towards somewhere permanent to record your suggestion.
*   If it is related to the design of the WordPress software itself, report it as an “enhancement” or “feature request” on [WordPress Core Trac](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/). Learn more about making a Core Trac ticket on the [Areas to Contribute](https://make.wordpress.org/design/handbook/get-involved/areas-contribute/) page.
*   If it is about the design of the WordPress.org website, or a similar non-software part of the WordPress project, create a new ticket on [WordPress Meta Trac](https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/).

## What should I do if I’ve found a design-related bug?

*   If it is related to the design of the WordPress software itself, report it as a “bug” on [WordPress Core Trac](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/). Learn more about making a Core Trac ticket on the [Areas to Contribute](https://make.wordpress.org/design/handbook/get-involved/areas-contribute/) page.
*   If the bug is on the WordPress.org website, or a similar non-software part of the WordPress project, create a new ticket on [WordPress Meta Trac](https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/).

## What software do I need to contribute?

Nothing but your brain!

However, members of the design team recommend:

*   [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/), [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/), or pencil & paper for wireframes.
*   [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/) for mockups.
*   [InVision](https://www.invisionapp.com/), [Marvel](https://marvelapp.com/), or [CodePen](https://codepen.io/) for prototypes.
*   A copy of the development version of WordPress for testing. You can either use the [Beta Tester plugin](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/testing/beta/), or install a local copy of the [develop repository](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/contribute/#the-repositories). You’ll need the second if you want to test code patches on Trac.

## Who makes the final call on design issues?

Within core focuses, the focus’ [Design Leads](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/01/04/focus-tech-and-design-leads/) make the final call. For components and other topics outside of focuses, the [Project Leads](https://wordpress.org/about/) have the final call.
