## デザインチームとは何か？

The design group is focused on the designing and developing the user interface. It’s a home for designers and UXers alike. There are regular discussions about mockups, design, and user testing.

## How to get involved?

Are you interested in joining the Design Team? Great! The team is open to anyone who wants to help out, and the process is simple. If you would like to join the team here is a useful guide.

## Communication

The [Make WordPress Design blog](https://make.wordpress.org/design/) is where you’ll find meeting agendas and summaries and occasionally other topics.

We communicate during meetings and asynchronously in the Slack [design channel](http://wordpress.slack.com/messages/design/). This is the best way to contact the team.

You can also view our [Trello Board](https://trello.com/c/RrAyxp7T) to get an overview of the major topics for the Design Team.

## Meeting Structure

Meetings follow this typical structure. Being able to copy and paste the basic meeting structure will make generating and posting agendas easier and more consistent.

Both the agendas and meeting summary notes are linked from [Make WordPress Design](https://make.wordpress.org/design/).
