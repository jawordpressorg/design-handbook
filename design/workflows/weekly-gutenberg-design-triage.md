# Weekly Gutenberg design triage

**How to run a weekly Gutenberg design triage session.** The weekly triage sessions are run in Slack every Tuesday 17:00 UTC. The goal is to triage issues in the `WordPress/Gutenberg` repo on GitHub that have the label `Needs Design Feedback`.

The `Needs Design Feedback` label is great for a slack triage session because all these issues require is some solid design reviews including feedback, suggestions, and direction. The slack meeting provides a great opportunity for anyone to contribute.

### Preparation

*   Open the `issues` tab in the `WordPress/Gutenberg` repo on GitHub.  
    [https://github.com/wordpress/gutenberg/issues](https://github.com/wordpress/gutenberg/issues)
*   Click on the `Label` dropdown and choose the `Needs Design Feedback` label.  
    [https://github.com/wordpress/gutenberg/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Needs+Design+Feedback%22](https://github.com/wordpress/gutenberg/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Needs+Design+Feedback%22)

Now you have a list of all the open issues that are labeled with `Needs Design Feedback`. Next, it’s important to sort this list.

*   Click on the `Sort` dropdown and decide how you would like to sort the list.

You have a few options for sorting. Sorting the list by “Oldest,” “Least commented,” or “Least recently updated” ensures you are targeting older issues to help move them forward.

### Running triage

*   Open the triage session by pinging the channel with `/here` if possible.
*   Type `<triage>` so that it is evident this is a triage session happening.
*   Welcome everyone to the session and briefly explain what’s going on. Something like this:

> Welcome to the Gutenberg design triage session. The goal is to help any Gutenberg issues with the `Needs Design Feedback` label. Today we’re looking at this list sorted by \[however you sorted\].

*   Provide a link to the list you are using so everyone can follow along.
*   Pick the first issue, open in your browser and then copy the link to share with everyone in Slack.
*   Give people a little time to read the issue.
*   Ask if anyone has any ideas. If you have your own mention those.
*   Discussion should happen in Slack but once it seems to reach a point ask:

> Would anyone like to update the issue or shall I?

*   The issue should then be updated and ‘moved on’ in a number of ways:
    
    *   Giving feedback.
    *   Asking the issue author for more information.
    *   If no feedback is needed, or if feedback is given, and you have the permissions in GitHub, please remove the label.
    
    *   If the agreed upon result is to close the issue, and you have permissions in GitHub to do so, please do.
*   Congratulations you’ve triaged that issue! Now onto the next and keep going until you reach 1 hour.
*   Close out triage by thanking everyone and typing `</triage>`.
