# Scope post

If you have a feature or proposal for the design and want to get a group of designers working on it, itâ€™s time for a scope post. A scope post is useful as a central point to explain the problem, what is needed and gather volunteers.

## Preparing a call

*   Collect all the background information to the design.
*   Ensure you have made or link issues/tickets.
*   Write a clear set of expectations/requirements for the designer(s) you need on this project.
*   Write a clear set of expectations/requirements for the project.

## Writing the scope

*   State the problem: what is trying to be solved?
*   State background and link in any tickets/issues or context. Ideally, you will already have a kickoff post if a feature, be sure to link to that.
*   What is the current status?
    *   Ideally, you write a call just before design but sometimes things get written a little further on in the process.
    *   State clearly what work has been done and what is to be done.
*   Get involved
    *   How can someone get involved?
    *   What specific tasks need help and what specific skills are you looking for?
    *   Measuring: how is it going to be tested?
    *   What time commitment will they need to make?
    *   Be clear also about what they will be expected to do and where. For example, give feedback on GitHub or Trac, be present in a particular meeting.
