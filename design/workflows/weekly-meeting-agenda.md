# Weekly meeting agenda

Each weekly meeting needs a schedule posted. The agenda post should be published at least a day before to give time for those in different timezones to comment. The goal of an agenda post is to structure the meeting but also collect topics to add.

## Preparation

Before writing any agenda post, check with other team reps to confirm what this week’s meeting will have as the focus. There is an [agenda doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1R1K2CNGQpq-bYWTTA9odSOeFCS5XFw0QSReyMrHkLok/edit?usp=sharing) and they should have added to that. Once you have that, it’s time to post.

## Posting the agenda

*   The following suggested format is useful to copy:

> Design meeting agenda for Wednesday <date>
> 
>   
> This week’s meeting will be at 19:00 UTC tomorrow in Slack [#design](https://make.wordpress.org/design/tag/design/).  
> 
> Here are the suggested topics:
> 
> – Housekeeping.
> 
> – Updates.
> 
> – Calls for help.
> 
> – Main topics.
> 
> – Open floor.
> 
>   
> If there is anything you would like to see added to the agenda, please leave a comment.

> [#meeting-agenda](https://make.wordpress.org/design/tag/meeting-agenda/)

*   Make sure to preview before posting.
*   Ensure you also have the [#meeting-agenda](https://make.wordpress.org/design/tag/meeting-agenda/) tag.
*   Post the agenda and make sure before the meeting if you are not facilitating, the person that does knows any agenda items added.
