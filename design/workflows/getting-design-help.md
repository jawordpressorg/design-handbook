# Asking for design help

Making sure you go to the right place can help you get the design help you need.

## Preparing

It’s a good idea to make sure you have a few things ready before getting help:

*   Know what type of help you want: do you want a review or do you want someone to work on a design?
*   Have the contacts of people already involved to loop them into the discussion.
*   If something has a timeline, be sure to also mention that when getting any help.
*   Have an idea of the type of designers you need help from. Do you need ones with interface knowledge? Experience designers or perhaps someone with an IA background?

## Getting help

Where you go will depend on what type of help you are looking for:

*   **Reporting a bug or enhancement:** Ideally anything to be worked on has a relevant trac ticket or GitHub issue:
    *   Reporting Gutenberg issue or enhancement:
        *   Visit: [https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/new/choose](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/new/choose)
        *   Select if a bug or new issue.
        *   Add labels of **‘needs design**’ if needs design or ‘**needs design feedback**’, if is already a design.
*   **Quick feedback:** If you just want casual feedback you can do this a few ways:
    *   Chat.wordpress.org  #design.
    *   Add as a comment to the weekly meeting agenda.
*   **Project proposal:** For larger, longer-term work, creating a ‘[Scope post](https://make.wordpress.org/design/handbook/workflows/writing-a-call-for-design/)‘ is a great step.
*   **Discussion:** If you would like to raise as a discussion topic please add to the weekly meeting agenda.
*   [Create a Trello card](https://trello.com/b/fnHScayo/design-team): Currently, you can also add a Trello card to the inbox. This usually is for specific tasks that aren’t an issue or ticket.
