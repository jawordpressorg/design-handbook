# Biweekly team rep update posts

Each fortnight a team rep write an update post on make/updates. Here is the workflow for this.

*   The post is to go on the [updates site](https://make.wordpress.org/updates/), written by a team rep.
*   Write the title with date of the update:  
      
    **Design team update <date>**
*   Add a little about what happened in those two weeks. Be sure to include any meeting notes as links and note triages that happened  
      
    *On Wednesday the team [met](https://make.wordpress.org/design/2020/03/04/design-meeting-notes-for-4-march-2020/) at the usual time of 19:00 UTC. Tuesday saw triage run also in [#design](https://make.wordpress.org/updates/tag/design/). The week before saw 2 triages and a [weekly meeting](https://make.wordpress.org/design/2020/02/27/design-meeting-notes-for-29-january-2020-2/).*  
    
*   Next, add what is coming up:  
      
    *Core triage: Monday 17:30 UTC  
    Gutenberg triage: Tuesday 17:00 UTC*  
    
*   Then add in any update posts, specifically Gutenberg:  
      
    *The Gutenberg design updates continue and you can catch them [here](https://make.wordpress.org/design/2020/01/31/gutenberg-phase-2-friday-design-update-44/) and [here](https://make.wordpress.org/design/2020/01/24/gutenberg-phase-2-friday-design-update-43/).*  
    
*   Discussions section can have anything post wise specific to make/design that needs surfacing. For example, a Figma discussion or post about icons. Put that under a heading ‘Discussions’.  
      
    *There is a point for feedback on this week’s notes about shifting the time for daylight saving. Have your say in the comments.*  
    
*   Next, wrap it in ‘Calls for involvement’:  
      
    *Gutenberg continues to need people to [give feedback](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/labels/Needs%20Design%20Feedback) and create [designs](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/labels/Needs%20Design).  
    The about page needs [help iterating](https://make.wordpress.org/design/2020/02/21/iterating-the-about-page/).  
    A call has been made for volunteers to run triage sessions.*  
    
*   Finally, add in a note about if having a WordCamp, if you want to:  
      
    If you are having a WordCamp that has a design contribution table, please reach out in #design so you can be added in future updates.  
    
*   You are ready to post, but put [#design](https://make.wordpress.org/design/tag/design/) on the post and then check a preview link before posting an update. Just to make sure you have any links working.

That’s it! You’ve written an update post and kept everyone in the project aware of all the awesome things going on within design.

Here is [an example](https://make.wordpress.org/updates/2020/03/06/design-team-update-march-6th/) to follow.
