# Writing a post

Should you wish to write a post on make/design there are a few things to go through.

### Asking to post

Usually, you will be an active contributor to the team and collaborate at least first with a team rep. Should you wish to write a post here are the steps:

*   Reach out in [#design](https://make.wordpress.org/design/tag/design/) or to a team rep to propose what you want to write on.
*   Should you put your hand up in a meeting to write about something, you can skip the first step.

### What can be posted?

The subjects are wide but just some of the things that can be posted are:

*   [Meeting notes](https://make.wordpress.org/design/handbook/workflows/weekly-meeting-notes/) and [agendas](https://make.wordpress.org/design/handbook/workflows/weekly-meeting-agenda/) have separate flows.
*   Proposals have a [workflow](https://make.wordpress.org/design/handbook/workflows/writing-a-call-for-design/).
*   If you are facilitating a contribution day for design, you can post about this.
*   Bigger picture ideas and discussions, for example, this one about ‘Blocks, Patterns and Layouts’.
*   User research and benchmarking. Usually, this relates to a specific focus or existing Trac ticket/issue.

This is just a suggested list if you have an idea just let everyone know in [#design](https://make.wordpress.org/design/tag/design/).

### Posting

Once you are ready to post, you will be given access to make/design (that’s this handbook sites blog). Here is a guide to posting:

*   Make sure you ask when posting would be a good time in [#design](https://make.wordpress.org/design/tag/design/). This likely will have been worked out before but just incase hasn’t been do not skip this step.
*   Write your post.
*   Save as draft.
*   Preview.
*   If it is your first post you need to get at least [1 team rep](https://make.wordpress.org/design/handbook/about-the-team/team-reps/) to approve before you post.
*   If it is not your first post still get at least 1 review from other design team members before posting, for example by asking in [#design](https://make.wordpress.org/design/tag/design/) or messaging a team rep or focus maintainer if working on a specific focus.
*   Once approved for posting, give one last check and publish.
*   Congratulations you just made an awesome post!

### Tips

Here are some useful points for writing posts:

*   If you want feedback, write your post in a Google doc first and invite collaboration there.
*   Make sure to test any videos and images across devices.
*   Make sure to link in any names to profiles if referring to someone.
*   Think about the reading length on the post, use headers and consider splitting across several posts if long.
*   Should you be asking for feedback, clearly state what you are asking for feedback on.
*   If the discussion is happening elsewhere along with the post, make sure to link back tit, for example, an issue.
