# Documenting a focus

### Preparing

To start let’s look at some examples which could fall into ‘Focus’:

*   A11y color/styling work for 5.3
*   Full site editing: as this starts to happen

### Writing

*   Create a new page for the focus and link under handbook section ‘focus’.
*   In that page have:
    *   Title of that focus.
    *   A description.
    *   Who is currently working on this.
    *   Timeline if known.
    *   Links to all places the work is going on.
    *   Space for updates with dates.
    *   Note a [#tag](https://make.wordpress.org/design/tag/tag/) to be used on make/design so people can follow all conversations.
*   Publish page and put in handbook category ‘Focuses’.
*   Add a link to that page in the front page in Focuses table.

> [Proposal to add a focus section to the handbook](https://make.wordpress.org/design/2019/11/18/proposal-to-add-a-focus-section-to-the-handbook/)

As work happens the person would perhaps:

*   Add a prototype.
*   Add a link to usability testing.

Once the focus is finished:

*   Remove link from the front page Focuses table.
*   Link page in the archive of Focuses page.
*   Remove category ‘Focuses’.
