The following people rotate each week to take notes.

*   @chaion07
*   @kellychoffman
*   @estelaris
*   @ashiquzzaman
*   @hedgefield

Rota for note taking happens in the order listed above, if someone taking notes is unable to make a week they can swap with someone else.

## Preparation

It’s a good idea before you step into taking notes to both have the agenda to hand and a Google doc ready. Google is suggested as it can be shared with everyone, really the document application is your choice but be sure to have a shareable format outside of your summary post.

## Taking notes

Here are some tips when taking notes:

*   Right at the start take a link to the opening as this will be reported in your notes: **“Read the meeting transcript in the Slack archives. \*(A Slack account is required\*”**
*   Don’t worry about keeping up, you can always scroll back through the conversation.
*   If there is anything shared you would like clarification on for notes, mention in meeting.
*   Don’t try and take every single comment, your notes are a summary not a transcript.

## Writing the note summary post

Once you have the notes, it’s now time to write up those in a summary post. There is a range of examples [you can follow](https://make.wordpress.org/design/tag/meeting-notes/).

*   Think about the structure of the meeting, your post should flow using headings to focus.
*   At the start link to the agenda and the archive if possible from Slack.
*   Create the post in make.wordpress.org/design and save as draft.
*   Before you post make sure all usernames linked are correct to profiles.
*   Make sure to tag your post with **[#meeting-notes](https://make.wordpress.org/design/tag/meeting-notes/)**.
*   Before you post, share with someone else that takes notes as a check.
*   If possible post your notes within 24 hours of the meeting.
