## Role of design team reps

In the WordPress open source project, each team has one or two (or more!) representatives, often abbreviated as *reps*. The role goes [way back to 2012](https://make.wordpress.org/updates/team-reps/) and most contributor teams have at least one. You can learn more about the team rep [role here](https://make.wordpress.org/updates/team-reps/).

A little note, it’s not called team **lead** for a reason. While the people elected as team reps will generally come from the pool of folks that people think of as experienced leaders, the team rep role does not mean it is now ‘your’ team, and the role is designed to change hands regularly. Similarly, you don’t have to be considered a lead to step into this role.

**Here are the main tasks:**

*   Post weekly meeting agenda and follow up notes. Team reps aren’t the only people who can post notes and agendas, so this is coordination. The team rep adds agenda items to a shared document.
*   Run the weekly design team meeting in Slack.
*   Write a fortnightly update post for [make.wordpress.org/updates](https://make.wordpress.org/updates)?
*   Give quarterly updates on the team when asked.
*   Triage and keep track of the team Trello inbox. This is used to fuel any meetings.
*   Call for new team reps when the time comes at the end of year tenure.

As a team rep, other tasks might fall to you in order to keep the team running, but in general, it’s a support role. On average the estimated time you would need for this role would be a few hours a week. With another team rep though, that time is shared.

This role is open to contributors of any level, not just full-time contributors. Like many good open-source processes, this work is done openly and can be shared.
