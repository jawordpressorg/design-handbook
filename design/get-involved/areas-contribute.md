# Areas to contribute

As a team, we contribute by supporting design across the entire project. Listed here are just some of the ways you can contribute currently.

## Core focuses

Currently, the focus is on Gutenberg phase two, but we also are involved in several components within core:

*   **Editor:** to help go along to weekly meetings:  
    18:00 CEST on Wednesday and join [#core-editor](https://make.wordpress.org/design/tag/core-editor/).

## Calls for design

We have a list of current designs [needed here](https://make.wordpress.org/design/calls-for-design/) and the Team Trello board [here](https://trello.com/b/fnHScayo/design-team).

## Core Trac design feedback

We have two keywords in trac which we as a team can help with: ‘UX\-feedback’ and ‘UI\-feedback’. What is trac? Trac is where bugs are reported and enhancement requests are made for WordPress.

Ideally, to do this, you will have a working [local testing environment](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/tutorials/installing-wordpress-locally/), however some tickets you will not need that for. Here is how a typical workflow would look for feedback in trac:

1.  Visit the report [here](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/tickets/ux-feedback).
2.  Ideally, work the oldest ticket first, you can click on the ‘modify’ column to sort.
3.  Click a ticket number or summary to view it.
4.  Read the entire ticket to know the full picture. If there is something to test then do that.
5.  Add your response as feedback, or make a mock-up and if required you can even make a patch. This is a great way to find tickets to get involved in.
6.  If you feel this ticket has enough feedback or needs no more (often it is good to get a few opinions), you can go a step further and mark as having feedback. This removes it from the report. Be aware you don’t have to do this step, most tickets need a lot of feedback.
7.  To flag as having had feedback, click the word ‘manual’ by the keyword:[![](https://i1.wp.com/make.wordpress.org/design/files/2017/04/2017-04-30-at-12.28.png?resize=776%2C530&ssl=1)](https://make.wordpress.org/design/handbook/get-involved/areas-contribute/2017-04-30-at-12-28/#main)
8.  Once you click ‘modify’ you can the add the word ‘has’ to the feedback tag:[![](https://i0.wp.com/make.wordpress.org/design/files/2017/04/2017-04-30-at-12.29.png?resize=467%2C188&ssl=1)](https://make.wordpress.org/design/handbook/get-involved/areas-contribute/2017-04-30-at-12-29/#main)
9.  Click ‘submit changes’ and now the ticket will not show in the feedback report.
10.  If you find a ticket you think needs action or discussion; bring it to the design team weekly meeting. You can also drop it on the channel at any time, but the meeting will get a faster response. Each meeting usually has a post on make.blog asking for topics, so if you can’t make the meeting, you can add a comment there.
11.  To learn about the terms used in trac and core, [check out the Glossary](_wp_link_placeholder).

Note: Please note that mentioning the tracTrac Trac is the place where contributors create issues for bugs or feature requests much like GitHub.[https://core.trac.wordpress.org/](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/). ticket on SlackSlack Slack is a Collaborative Group Chat Platform [https://slack.com/](https://slack.com/). The WordPress community has its own Slack Channel at [https://make.wordpress.org/chat/](https://make.wordpress.org/chat/). will change its date. This means that it will move in the triage list. So if you do so, please make sure to update the ticket if possible.

## Meta Trac design feedback

In addition to Core Trac, we have a second Trac for issues related to the WordPress.org website and associated projects, [Meta Trac](https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/). You won’t need a local testing environment to work on most Meta tickets. Visit the [“Needs Designer” report](https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=accepted&status=assigned&status=new&status=reopened&status=reviewing&keywords=~needs-ui&keywords=~needs-ux&keywords=~ui-feedback&keywords=~ux-feedback&group=component&col=id&col=summary&col=keywords&col=status&col=owner&col=type&col=priority&col=component&order=keywords&report=9) to get started.
