<!-- We have two keywords in trac which we as a team can help with: ‘ux-feedback’ and ‘ui-feedback’. What is trac? Trac is where bugs are reported and enhancement requests are made for WordPress. -->
trac には、チームとして役立つ2つのキーワード ‘ux-feedback’ と ‘ui-feedback’ があります。 trac とは何でしょう？ Trac は、WordPress に対するバグが報告されたり、拡張のリクエストが送られている処です。

Ideally to do this, you will have a working [local testing environment](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/tutorials/installing-wordpress-locally/), however some tickets you will not need that for. Here is how a typical workflow would look for feedback in trac:

1.  Visit the report [here](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/tickets/ux-feedback).
2.  Ideally work oldest ticket first, you can click on the ‘modify’ column to sort.
3.  Click a ticket number or summary to view it.
4.  Read the entire ticket to know the full picture. If there is something to test then do that.
5.  Add your response as feedback, or make a mock-up and if required you can even make a patch. This is a great way to find tickets to get involved in.
6.  If you feel this ticket has enough feedback or needs no more (often it is good to get a few opinions), you can go a step further and rmark as having feedback. This removes it from the report. Be aware you don’t have to do this step, most tickets need a lot of feedback.
7.  To flag as having had feedback, click the word ‘manual’ by the keyword:[![](https://i0.wp.com/make.wordpress.org/design/files/2017/04/2017-04-30-at-12.28.png?resize=776%2C530&ssl=1)](https://make.wordpress.org/design/handbook/get-involved/areas-contribute/2017-04-30-at-12-28/#main)
8.  Once you click ‘modify’ you can the add the word ‘has’ to the feedback tag:[![](https://i2.wp.com/make.wordpress.org/design/files/2017/04/2017-04-30-at-12.29.png?resize=467%2C188&ssl=1)](https://make.wordpress.org/design/handbook/get-involved/areas-contribute/2017-04-30-at-12-29/#main)
9.  Click ‘submit changes’ and now the ticket will not show in the feedback report.
10.  If you find a ticket you think needs action, or discussion; bring it to the design team weekly meeting. You can also drop it in the channel at anytime, but the meeting will get a faster response. Each meeting usually has a post on make.blog asking for topics, so if you can’t make the meeting, you can add a comment there.

Note: Please note that mentioning the a trac ticket on Slack will change its date. This means that it will move in the triage list. So if you do so, please make sure to update the ticket if possible.

In addition to Core Trac, we have a second Trac for issues related to the WordPress.org website and associated projects, [Meta Trac](https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/). You won’t need a local testing environment to work on most Meta tickets. Visit the [“Needs Designer” report](https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=accepted&status=assigned&status=new&status=reopened&status=reviewing&keywords=~needs-ui&keywords=~needs-ux&keywords=~ui-feedback&keywords=~ux-feedback&group=component&col=id&col=summary&col=keywords&col=status&col=owner&col=type&col=priority&col=component&order=keywords&report=9) to get started.
