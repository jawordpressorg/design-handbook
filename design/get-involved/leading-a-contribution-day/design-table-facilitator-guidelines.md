<!-- # Design Table Facilitator Guidelines -->
# デザイン班のファシリテーターガイドライン

<!-- This page outlines a baseline format to run the Design Table during WordCamp Contributor Days. It’s not meant to be followed strictly, but it’s a useful guideline especially for people that are running the table for the first time. -->
このページは、 WordCamp のコントリビューターデイで、デザイン班が活動するための基本的なフォーマットについての説明です。 このガイドラインに厳密に従う必要はありませんが、初めてデザイン班をファシリテートする人にとっては役立つでしょう。


<!-- The idea is to have clear instructions that anyone with some degree of knowledge of the WordPress design work can follow. Also, having these as a written guideline allows for improvements over time and future tweaks for different contexts. -->
その考え方は、 WordPress のデザイン部分についてある程度の知識があれば誰でも作業できる明確な指示、ということです。また、これらを文書化したガイドラインがあれば、徐々に改善していったり、さまざまな状況に応じて、将来的に微調整していくことができます。

<!-- The guiding principles for this is to have them **connected to the global community** and show them in a **practical way how to contribute**. -->
そのための指針となる原則は、**参加者をグローバルなコミュニティ** とを結びつけ、 **貢献する方法を実践的に示す** ことです。

<!-- # **Plan** -->
# **プラン**

<!-- Facilitating the Design Table work during Contributor Day isn’t a difficult task but takes some experience with the community and it can be very intense on the day. -->
コントリビューターデイの間にデザイン班の活動をスムーズに進めるのは難しいことではないですが、コミュニティである程度の経験が必要で、とてもハードな一日になるかもしれません。

<!-- We suggest to have at least direct experience of these: -->
少なくとも、次のような「直接的に役立つ経験」を積むことをお勧めします。

<!-- *   Have participated at least once in a Design Triage chat in [design](https://wordpress.slack.com/messages/design/) Slack.
*   Have practice of the tools used during the day (Slack, Trac, GitHub, Trello, …).
*   Have contributed to at least a couple of tickets (Trac, optionally GitHub and others). -->
* [design](https://wordpress.slack.com/messages/design/) SlackにあるDesign Triageチャットに少なくとも1回は参加しておきましょう。
* コントリビューターデイで使用するツール（Slack、Trac、GitHub、Trelloなど）に慣れましょう。
* 少なくとも2〜3枚のチケット（Trac、オプションでGitHubなど）をコントリビュートしておきましょう。

<!-- ### **Before Contributor Day** -->
### **コントリビューターデイの前に**

<!-- Overall the preparation work shouldn’t take more than a few hours among the various things, and gets easier the more you do it. -->
事前準備全体はあまり時間をかけるべきではなく、また簡単であるほど準備がしやすくなります。  

<!-- 1.  **Review task sources** — during the contributor day we want to propose to the table a series of activities that can be taken up by individuals and groups. This means that the Facilitator should have reviewed the list of possible tasks and should already have an idea on at least some of them, so they don’t have to catch up on the day.  The list can get long, so don’t try to know review everything, but cover enough items to be able to provide an example to the group. -->
1. **タスクのソースをレビューしておく**  - コントリビューターデイにおいて、個人やグループで行うことができる一連のアクティビティをその場に提案したいと思います。 つまり、ファシリテーターは、すでにタスクのリストをレビューし、少なくともいくつかについてアイデアを持っている状態なので、当日にキャッチアップする必要はありません。 リストは長くなる可能性があるので、すべてをレビューするのではなく、グループに例を提供するのに十分な項目だけをカバーするようにしてください。
    <!-- 1.  **Trac** — review the [needs ‘ui-feedback’ and ‘ux-feedback’ tags](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/report/35?sort=modified&asc=1&page=1) and make sure there are good tickets for the discussion. Try to have 2-3 simple ones ready you know in detail to use as examples for contribution.
    2.  **GitHub** — if there are projects that are currently being worked on in WordPress but are currently tracked on GitHub (i.e. [Gutenberg’s ‘Needs Design Feedback’](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Needs+Design+Feedback%22)), review these issues too.
    3.  **Trello** — review existing tasks on the [design board](https://trello.com/b/fnHScayo/design-team) to find items that can be picked up and either completed or at least iterated upon during the day. -->
    1. ** Trac **  -  [‘ui-feedback’ および ‘ux-feedback’ タグ](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/report/35?sort=modified&asc=1&page=1) をチェックして、議論にふさわしいチケットがあることを確認してください。 コントリビュートの例として使えるよう、あなたがよく知っている簡単なものを2〜3つほど用意するようにしましょう。
    2. ** GitHub **  - 現在WordPressで進行中で、現在GitHubでトラックされているプロジェクトがある場合（例：[Gutenbergの 'Needs Design Feedback'](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Needs+Design+Feedback%22)、これらの issue も確認しましょう。
    3. ** Trello **  -  [design board](https://trello.com/b/fnHScayo/design-team) で既存のタスクを確認、ピックアップして、コントリビューターデイのあいだに完了または少なくとも繰り返し実行できるアイテムを見つけましょう。
2.  **Logistics** — ask the details about the space during contributor day.
    1.  Ask how many designers are expected to join.
    2.  It’s ideal if there’s a wall for post-its or a whiteboard. If that’s available, get post-its and markers with a medium-sized tip (like Sharpies).
    3.  Review start and end time of the Contributor Day, and specifically start and end work of the tables (as there’s an intro and a closing remarks which will can take about 30 minutes each).
    4.  See if the space allows for having a separate room and/or a projector. This can be very useful to guide people through.
3.  **Rehearse** — read the Day Outline below, and try out, maybe even speaking aloud, what you’re going to say. Have a read of the [design about page](https://make.wordpress.org/design/handbook/about-the-team/) for extra reference.
4.  **Rest** — be sure to have good rest the day before, and prepare supplies to have with you during the day (i.e. water, snacks, etc).
5.  **Don’t go alone** — consider having someone to support you facilitating, this becomes more important as you get a large amount of contributor.

### **Day Outline**

Be ready for an intense day that will also flow really fast. Each of the tasks here can take a lot of time, so make sure to not spend too much time on setup and logistics and try to get people on actual work quickly. For large group this might need more than one facilitator, or cut down in setup time. Remember: the idea is to have people contribute in the long run, and do something they can feel good about on the day.  

Also, be ready for internet to be down. It often happens with so many people joining. In the preparation above it may be helpful to save full screenshots of 2-3 issues for discussion if internet goes down. .  

1.  Contributor Day Intro
    1.  Before the work at the table starts, the design table Facilitator usually prepares a short introduction to be given on stage, explaining who they are and what they are going to do on the day, and inviting people to join the design table.
    2.  The Facilitator also invites other tables to come to the design table if they need design help.
2.  Design Table Intro
    1.  Thank people for joining.
    2.  Explain how design contributes to WordPress.
    3.  Give a general outline of the work the group is going to do today (loose agenda, tasks, etc).
3.  Ice Breaker / Intro People
    1.  Have everyone introduce themselves briefly: **name**, where they are **from**, their **job** title.
        *   If you have a wall and post-its: have everyone draw their own portrait (stylized! do it first as an example) and under it name and job title. Everyone then says hello while putting their post-it on the wall.
    2.  You can also run a quick ice-breaker if there’s time ([examples](http://gamestorming.com/category/icebreakers/)).
4.  Setup
    1.  Explain how these communication tools (Slack, Trello) are used to collaborate on WordPress, and then help them setup. Tell everyone to say “Hi” in the [design](https://wordpress.slack.com/messages/design/) Slack channel once they have completed setting up.
    2.  For the setup, Slack is the most important part as it allows people to be in touch with the community after the Contributor Day. As the setup can take a lot of time, you can choose to ignore other setups to focus on Slack.
    3.  Slack
        *   Invite:  
            [https://make.wordpress.org/chat/](https://make.wordpress.org/chat/)  
    4.  Trello
        *   Invite:  
            [https://trello.com/invite/b/fnHScayo/ed40e89e3bd2e876975fbbc1175e3084/design-team](https://trello.com/invite/b/fnHScayo/ed40e89e3bd2e876975fbbc1175e3084/design-team)  
    5.  Staging Setup
        *   Depending on the tasks, it can be useful for everyone to have a local test installation of WordPress to work with. This can take a long time to setup, and an available internet connection, so be careful in this specific task as it can take a lot of time (and without internet might not be possible at all).
        *   The easiest way might be to use  [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/downloads/).
        *   If they don’t want to have a local install and internet works, you can suggest to use [http://poopy.life/](http://poopy.life/).
    6.  While people create accounts
        *   Email — go around and ask for their email to know if they are willing to receive a survey after the Contributor Day. Make sure this email is used only once, and only for the survey (for privacy reasons).
        *   Prepare Tasks — if there’s a whiteboard or a wall available put post-its on it in a row, one post-it for each work category (i.e. Testing, Triage, Trello, etc). Leave space below so people can move their “portrait” post-it under the specific column to signal they will work on it.
5.  Triage Simulation
    1.  Once everyone is in Slack, do a design triage simulation (i.e. one or two tickets you’ve prepared before, not all of them).
    2.  If possible and time zones are available, have someone remote join the discussion. You might have to arrange this beforehand.
    3.  The idea here is to have them experience as close as possible how the weekly design triage works, so they are comfortable in contributing the next time it happens.
    4.  See [here for an example](https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C02S78ZAL/p1536889396000100).
6.  Tasks Explanation
    1.  If you have prepared the columns with post-its on the wall, ask people to move their “portrait” post-it under the column they want to work with. If not, call out each task and have people raise their hand to organize the groups.
    2.  Have people that will work on the same tasks sit together (i.e. all the people doing testing, all the people reviewing issues, etc).
    3.  Have the people start working. Go around each group one at time and get them started.
7.  Check In
    1.  Set a time, likely after lunch break, to regroup. It should be halfway through the day. It doesn’t have to be a group activity, it can also be simply going around person by person or group by group and ask how they are progressing and see if you can clarify things.
8.  Collect Work Done
    1.  Be sure you know exactly when the closing remarks for the Contributor Day will happen.
    2.  About 30 minutes before, go around each group and collect the work they have done during the day in order to present it.
9.  End of Day Summary
    1.  At the end you’ll be likely be asked to do a recap of the work done at the design table. These are informations that are useful to summarize:
        1.  How many contributors?
        2.  How many people onboarded (i.e. on [#design](https://make.wordpress.org/design/tag/design/) Slack)?
        3.  What activities were done (i.e. what were the different groups)?
        4.  Any highlight?
