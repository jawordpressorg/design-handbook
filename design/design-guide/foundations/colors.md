Colors are one of the key aspects when it comes to brand recognition. Making sure we use the right hues (colors) is essential to that effect. Check out the following list to find the official WordPress colors. (Also available on [this codepen](https://codepen.io/hugobaeta/full/RNOzoV/))

## Colors

Colors are separated into three groups. The Blues, the Grays, and Auxiliary colors. The most recognizable colors are, obviously, the Blues and Grays. The Auxiliary hues can be used for various reasons, and come in a variety of values, with some tints (added white), tones (mix with another hue), and shades (added black)
