# Discussion topics

Beyond the summit we have subjects as a community to discuss. As part of the 2017 summit search for topics, we made a list. Here are the ones we are not discussing at the summit but still need tackling.

*   Diversity: how do we reflect the diversity of our users in those designing?
*   Pattern library: the need for this is getting more, how can we make it happen?
*   What does it look like for WordPress to be design-led, and how can we as a team lead that effort?
*   Outreach inside WordPress: how can we find and also send designers easily to all areas of WordPress?
*   How do we establish a culture of productive design critiques?
*   How do we make research part of our process?
*   How do we establish a proper design process across the entire project of WordPress?
